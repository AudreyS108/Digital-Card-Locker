                We haven't really talked that much lately but hey I still wanted to wish you a happy birthday! 
                <br>
                Thank you for being funny and awesome, and also thanks for introducing me to Fnaf and Helluva back then.
                <br>
                Hope you have a great holiday and a great year ahead of you. 
                <br>
                Also I hope we can hang out more in the future, if you'd like!
                <br>
                <br>
