# Digital Card Locker
This project is a continuation of my CSS-Birthday-Card project.   
This is a website which requires you to input a specific code to receive a card, whether it be for a birthday, Christmas, or other celebration.   
Users would be given a link to the website, and a code to input along with it, thus the name Digital Card Locker.

Why I made this
-
After making the first digital birthday card, I wanted to make many more, so I could give them to other friends, family, and more.    
However, I encountered a few issues. Firstly, I wanted to use Github Pages to ___ my website, but my repository had to be public to do so. Having a public repository was an issue because in some cards, I had enclosed gift cards and/or private messages. If they were on public, anyone could enter and access those details, which I definitely did not want. Secondly, I didn't want to have to make a new repository for every birthday card. I would end up with 10+ repositories for similar projects, which would cause clutter.     
    
Therefore, I decided to compile all of my cards into one website. I needed each user to be redirected to a specific card, so I required the user to input a code.

My next steps for this project:
-
- Add encryption to the code so that people cannot open random pages (for privacy reasons)    
- Add animations to the Home page for better aesthetics.
